## Features

- **URL Input**: Users can provide URLs as input for the chatbot.
- **Chatbot Interface**: Interact with the application via a user-friendly chatbot interface.
- **Advanced Language Models**: Utilizes cutting-edge language models from Hugging Face.
- **Embeddings and Retrieval**: Uses embeddings and retrieval mechanisms to enhance response accuracy.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.

## Installation

To get started with the RAG application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-application.git
    cd rag-application
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser. You can then input URLs and interact with the chatbot.

## Technologies

The RAG application is built using the following technologies:

- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **LangChain**: For chaining together multiple language model calls.
- **Hugging Face LLMs**: State-of-the-art language models for generating responses.
- **Embeddings**: Used to convert text into dense vector representations.
- **ChromaDB**: For storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently.
